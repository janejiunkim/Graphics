<h1> Final Project Proposal </h1>

<p> I've always been interested in game design and a lot of great games came out this year which inspired the idea for my final project. One of my favorite games, Final Fantasy 7, was remade and released in April. The original Final Fantasy 7 came out in 1997 and the graphics can not even compare to what they are now. When looking at them side by side, it's truly shocking to see the evolution of video game graphics over the past two decades. Obviously, the graphics of the remake would be way too difficult for me to even consider trying to create something similar, so I turned to another old-time favorite that was released this year for the Nintendo Switch, Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>

<p> Through the editions of Animal Crossing, which was first released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64, you can still see the evolution of graphics into what it has become today (though not as drastically as through FF7). The cute character designs and real life simulation draws players into the game and inspired me to create graphics with similar aesthetics. For my project, I hope to emulate a character design for the animal residents of the game. </p>
